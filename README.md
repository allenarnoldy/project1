# Wallet Watchers

## Description

Wallet Watchers is a simple, lightweight app that allows you to input, track, and categorize expenses. We wanted to build an app to help people stay on top of their finances with ease. Currently, Wallet Watch allows you to input expenses under certain categories. In the future, we plan to add much more functionality, such as custom expense categories, income tracking, savings goals, and bank syncing.
