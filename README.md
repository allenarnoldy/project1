# Wallet Watchers

## Description

Wallet Watchers is a simple, lightweight app that allows you to input, track, and categorize expenses. As our first group project, we wanted to build an app to help people stay on top of their finances with ease. Currently, Wallet Watchers allows you to input expenses under certain categories. In the future, we plan to add much more functionality, such as custom expense categories, income tracking, savings goals, and bank syncing.

This project taught us about how to build a responsive web app using HTML, CSs and Javascript; how to divide and assign tasks, and how to collaborate using Git and GitHub without overwriting each other's work.
